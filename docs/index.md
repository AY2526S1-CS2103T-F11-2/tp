**TutorPal is a desktop app that helps tuition centres and
private tutors manage students, classes, attendance, consultations,
grades and paymentsâ€”fast.**
It has a clean GUI, but is optimised for keyboard users via a CLI (Command Line Interface)

* If you are interested in using TutorPal, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TutorPal, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
